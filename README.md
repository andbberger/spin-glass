Physics-centric Boltzmann machine implementation (under active development)

Supports recurrent (Hopfield) and feed-forward network topologies (RBM)

Updated asynchronously. 

Supports simulated annealing (physics-centric implementation lends itself to this naturally)



In the works:

   -Minimum Probability Flow learning
   
   -Class for managing and constructing networks
